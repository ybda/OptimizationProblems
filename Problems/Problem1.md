A bakery wants to maximize its profit by producing two types of cakes: Chocolate Cake and Vanilla Cake. The bakery has limited resources:

- 480 minutes of oven time per day
- 300 pounds of flour per day
- 200 pounds of sugar per day

The profit, oven time, flour, and sugar requirements for each type of cake are:

| Cake Type |	Profit |	Oven Time (minutes) |	Flour (pounds) |	Sugar (pounds) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chocolate |	15 |	17 |	10 |	8 |
| Vanilla |	12 |	15 |	8 |	6 |

The bakery wants to determine the optimal number of each type of cake to produce per day to maximize profit while satisfying the resource constraints.
